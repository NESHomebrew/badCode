# badCode
An example program of what not do do when writing a simple console application in C++

I was given a simple task to create an interactive simulation that Gen 1 Pokemon attack and defense types have against each other. The idea however, was to keep the project functional, but ignore all effort to write good code.  In fact, extra emphasis was given to make it as unreadable and confusing as possible. While I could have gone much further, for an extremely simple program it was plenty confusing.

Here it is, with no other context or explanation... enjoy.
